      <description>There are so many great big men in the NBA right now, but who is the best?
Because of the recent emphasis on spacing and 3-point shooting, the role of the big man has diminished in recent years.

      <description>My name is Peter Rice and I am a Sports Journalism Major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a passion for sports all my life and I want to make a career for myself in the sports industry! After graduating high school in 2018 I attended South Dakota State University for two years before transferring to UNL. While there, I was a student coach for the Jackrabbit football team where I traveled along taking video and entering stats along with various other tasks.</description>
